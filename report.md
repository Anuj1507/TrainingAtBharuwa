Internship Daily Report
# Day 1

Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
Summary:
Studied the core principles of OOP — including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Understood how these concepts promote reusability, scalability, and maintainability in software design.

# Day 2

Topic: C# Basics
Summary:
Explored foundational C# concepts such as:

Output statements and comments

Variables and data types

Type casting and user input

Operators and math functions

Strings and booleans

Conditional statements (if...else, switch)

Looping constructs (while, for)

Control flow statements (break, continue)

# Day 3

Topic: Practical Implementation of C# Concepts
Mini Projects:

Calculator
Goal: Practice operators, conditionals, loops, and methods.
Simple Version:
Take two numbers and perform +, -, *, / operations based on user choice.
Concepts Covered:

Console.ReadLine()

Convert.ToInt32()

if...else or switch

Basic arithmetic operators

Bank Management System (Console-Based)
Status: In Progress
Description:
Designed a console-based Bank Management System that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and view account details — implementing OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

# Day 4

Topic: Advanced C# Concepts
Activities:

Continued learning C# from the following video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrtFtdTTfv0

New concepts learned:

var keyword

Numeric formatting

TryParse() method

Created a FizzBuzz game

Verbatim string literals (@"")

Tools Used:

Visual Studio Code for .NET

Additional Work:

Solved several SQL problems

Found an advanced C# topics video to cover next month

# Day 5

Topic: String Comparison, Password Validation, Array Operations, and Exception Handling in C#


1.String Comparison: Learned how to compare strings using both == (which checks for reference and value) and Equals() (which checks only for value). Also explored creating strings from character arrays and verifying their equality.

2.String Operations: Implemented simple string operations like checking substrings using Contains() and verifying non-empty strings using !string.IsNullOrEmpty().

3.Password Checker: Created a small program that validates a user-entered password based on specific conditions such as:

Minimum length of 8 characters

At least one uppercase and one lowercase letter

Confirmation of the password by re-entry

Re-prompting until correct input is provided

4.Array and List Operations: Practiced sorting and reversing arrays using Array.Sort() and Array.Reverse(), and worked with lists by adding elements and checking their count.

5.Exception Handling: Implemented robust input validation using try-catch blocks. Handled different exception types such as:

FormatException — for non-numeric input

OverflowException — for numbers exceeding integer limits

General Exception — for any unknown errors
This ensured the program runs smoothly even with invalid user inputs.
